GOAL: Work on Assignment D
NOTES: Worked on plan memo for fish game, finish inital system software component plan and milestones
DURATION: 2 hours
NEXT: 10/03 2:00pm Discord

DATE/TIME: 10/03 2:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Understand the format of self evaluations and fill it in for the planning assignment for fish game.
NOTES: Didn't run into major problems, did notice a lot of missing components in our planning after doing the reflection
DURATION: 30 minutes
NEXT: 10/06 Discord

Assignment 1 Conclusion:
For assignment 1 of planning for the fish game system, we found that we tunneled vision too hard on the low level components and in the future need to think of more whole picture to encompass more components for needed functions, and the self reflection for this assignment was helpful in us realizing this point.


Milestone 2: The Game Pieces

DATE/TIME: 10/06 4:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Look through the programing task and understand what components we need to satisfy all the game piece requirements.
NOTES: Setup all the function signatures and purposes wating for implementation.
DURATION: 1 hour
NEXT: 10/07 Discord

DATE/TIME: 10/07 5:30pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Implement the functions that we have setup in our last meeting based on the purpose and signatures.
NOTES: Finish the rough implementation need to run through some unittest to make sure of proper functionality.
DURATION: 2 hour
NEXT: 10/08 Discord

DATE/TIME: 10/08 3:30pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Finish up testing bug for implemented functions and plan for game state.
NOTES: Didn't end up adding many unittest due to deadline and the planning was still a little rough.
DURATION: 1 hour
NEXT: 10/11 Discord

DATE/TIME: 10/11 3:20pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Look through our commits for milestone 2 and fill in the self eval accordingly.
NOTES: We missed the original self eval deadline but extension helped. We were able to identify most of the functionality needed and give a proper pointer to them in the commits.
DURATION: 30 minutes
NEXT: 10/13 Discord

Milestone 2 Conclusion:
For this milestone we felt a little crunch on time due to other commitments and the way we ended up implementing the functions might have need more time for us to debug. We also got picked for code walk for this milestone, and actually found it pretty helpful, got a lot of feedbacks on what we should improve. Lastly we had a small hiccup in remebering to do the self eval but luckly the deadline for this one was extended, will have to setup a mechanism to remind us to do this on time from here on.


Milestone 3: The Game State

DATE/TIME: 10/13 4:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Look through all game state requirements and outline all needed functions along with thier purpose and signatures.
NOTES: After the outline on the different functions got a little bit time left to have some initial implementation.
DURATION: 2 hours
NEXT: 10/15 Discord

DATE/TIME: 10/15 4:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Finish implementing what we outline in last meeting for game state
NOTES: Fished the design and programming task
DURATION: 3 hours
NEXT: 10/16 Discord

DATE/TIME: 10/16 4:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Fill in self eval
NOTES: Fished the self eval, did notice we missed a few things
DURATION: 30 min
NEXT: 10/16 Discord

Milstone 3 Conclusion
For this milestone we did our best with the time we had to fix any of the problems we had from ealier milestones and think we manage to get the gamestate
implemented to a ok state


Milestone 4: The Game Tree

DATE/TIME: 10/20 4:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Start on the the integration test and outline what we need to implement for the game tree
NOTES: No major problems here, did found that we need to add a few function to game state to support game tree functionality
DURATION: 2 hours
NEXT: 10/16 Discord

DATE/TIME: 10/22 4:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Finished up implementing the integration tests and outlined functionality for game tree
NOTES: No major problems here, need to spend sometime figuring out bugs in integration test harness due to turn queue
DURATION: 4 hours
NEXT: 10/24 Discord

DATE/TIME: 10/24 4:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Filled in self eval
NOTES: Finished the self eval and found a few things we missed again
DURATION: 30 min
NEXT: 10/27 Discord

Milstone 4 Conclusion
For this milestone we had some issues with finding a bug in the integration test when taking in an json array and converting it to python tuple, ended up spending quite some time to figure out this bug. And we have to go back and add
some functionality to gamestate and fix previously unknown bugs with the turn queue.


Milestone 5: The Strategy

DATE/TIME: 10/27 4:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Start the integration test and outline the functionalities for the strategy class
NOTES: Implemented the haress and outlined functionalities, still need to fill those in and make up test cases for the integration test
DURATION: 2 hours
NEXT: 10/29 Discord

DATE/TIME: 10/29 3:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Finished up writing the integration test and implement the rest of the programming taks and designs
NOTES: Finished on time had to spent sometime to understand what we really need for the design task
DURATION: 5 hours
NEXT: 10/31 Discord

DATE/TIME: 10/31 3:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Fill in self eval
NOTES: No major problem
DURATION: 30 min
NEXT: 11/05 Discord

Milstone 5 Conclusion
For this milestone we failed to go back and update some of the older code based on the feedback that we have gotten and only realize until we did the self evaluations, but we have not been doing too well in outlining everything that we need in our design tasks.


Milestone 6: Games

DATE/TIME: 11/05 3:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Finished all the integration test and programming/design task
NOTES: Have to be in a crunch due to the nature of this week being election week and we both wanted to have soemtime to pay attention to the news
DURATION: 7 hours
NEXT: 11/07 Discord

DATE/TIME: 11/07 3:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Fill in self eval
NOTES: Finished and realize we miss a few things we needed
DURATION: 30 min
NEXT: NA

Milstone 6 Conclusion
This assginment was on a really time crunch and we haven't got back and did any refactoring on the pervious milestones based on feedback, we did learn that we need to have better planning for different situations.


Milestone 7: The clean up

DATE/TIME: 11/10 7:00pm
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Meet new partner and get familirize with new code base
NOTES: Went through most of the code base and start outlining things we needed to do to clean up the code base
DURATION: 1 hour
NEXT: 11/12

DATE/TIME: 11/10 9:00 am
MEDIUM/PHYSICAL LOCATION: Discord
GOAL: Goes through todo list and document rework and bug fixes
NOTES: Still have to spend sometime to really get use to the code base
DURATION: 2 hour
NEXT: 11/14

Milstone 7 Conclusion
From this milestone because I am the one swtich from my original code base, have to really spend some time to understand what is going on with the new one and realize that even though the design of the two code bases are similar there are quite a few implementation differences.
