# AI Competition Playground

This project aims to design and implement an AI competition playground through a tournament system that allows user implemented AIs based on the specified protocol to compete with each other in different board games, and through doing so, learn about the various fundamental AI algorithms and concepts. This is build on top of the original project from my [software development course](https://felleisen.org/matthias/4500-f20/assignments.html) in [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), where the original system was designed only for the board game Fish with the intention to practice team based full cycle software development for a multi component system, the original core back-end components were implemented in Python and the continuation of the project continues to use python as the main back-end language for both compatibility and availability of established AI toolkits, in addition a basic front-end will be implemented with React for signup, pacticipating in a tournament and spectating. The end goal of this project will aim to implement the rest of the fundamental AI algorithms inhouse as specified in [todo.md](https://github.com/JCDevSpace/board-game-ai/blob/master/todo.md#ai-algorithms) and made accessible through the web leveraging existing cloud technologies.

## Installation

Clone the project repo to the local system.

To run a quick test to verify that the project is working properly on the local system.  

```bash
cd ~/board-game-ai
./xtest
```

This will run all the unittests and integration tests under the `Test` directory of the repo.
