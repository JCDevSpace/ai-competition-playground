    A Manager is a combination of:
    -list(IPlayer):
        a list of active players still in contest of the tournament
    -list(IPlayer):
        a list of players that already lost in the tournament
    -list(IPlayer):
        a list of kicked players
    -list(IObserver):
        a list of observers that recieves any tournament progress updates

    A Manager is responsible for managing a tournament of board games, hanlding creations of games by assigning groups of players to different referees for individual games then gathering the winners from each game to advance to next rounds. The manager is also responsible for notifying all players and observers of tournament progresses as well as informing each on the start and end result of a tournament.

    The manager loads configuration of tournament from the corresponding configuration files, configuring things like what kind of board games to run, and rules for determining the final winner.

    The tournament uses a knock-out elimination system. The top finisher(s) of every game of round n move on to round n+1. The tournament ends when two tournament rounds of games in a row produce the exact same winners or when there are only the minimum number or less player left.

    The allocation of players to games works as follows. The manager starts by assigning them to games with the maximal number of player permitted randomly. Once the number of remaining players drops below the maximal number and canâ€™t form a game, the manager backtracks by one game and tries games of size one less than the maximal number and so on until all players are assigned.

    At the start of a tournament, the manager informs all the player and observers that a tournament will be started.

    After one rounds of game, the manager informs all player and observers of players who advanced and got knocked out. 

    At the end of the tournament, the manager informs all player and observers the tournament results.

    player who got kicked from game for whatever reason will not be inform of any new information.
