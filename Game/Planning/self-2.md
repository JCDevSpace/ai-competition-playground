## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

A fundamental guideline of Fundamentals I, II, and OOD is to design
methods and functions systematically, starting with a signature, a
clear purpose statement (possibly illustrated with examples), and
unit tests.

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data description of tiles, including an interpretation:

https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/wickett/blob/dd6be1d471bb0ed3f5d32aa83939cdb92bdbef00/Fish/Common/Model/Board.py#L3-L5

- the data description of boards, include an interpretation:

https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/wickett/blob/dd6be1d471bb0ed3f5d32aa83939cdb92bdbef00/Fish/Common/Model/Board.py#L3


- the functionality for removing a tile:
  - purpose: We didnt add purpose statements
  
  - signature: We had no specified signature but by the arguments of the function show that it will take in the row and column of the position where a tile should be removed. 
  
  - unit tests: 
  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/wickett/blob/dd6be1d471bb0ed3f5d32aa83939cdb92bdbef00/Fish/Common/UnitTests/BoardTest.py#L48-L53

- the functiinality for reaching other tiles on the board:
  - purpose: We didnt add in purpose statements
  
  - signature: We did not have a specificly stated signature.
  
  - unit tests: 
  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/wickett/blob/dd6be1d471bb0ed3f5d32aa83939cdb92bdbef00/Fish/Common/UnitTests/BoardTest.py#L64-L75

The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.

  WARNING: all such links must point to your commit "5a56869d96b3c6dc24af63c57ac813699097d788".
  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.
  Here is an example link:

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
