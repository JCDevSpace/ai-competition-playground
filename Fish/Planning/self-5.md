- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin movements for turns
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/wickett/tree/c82cb324192449b4a09a686c5841bef2d88f10d0/Fish/Common/game_tree.py#L1-L5


- the unit tests for the penguin placement strategy 
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/wickett/tree/c82cb324192449b4a09a686c5841bef2d88f10d0/Fish/Player/UnitTests/StrategyTest.py#L8-L68

- the unit tests for the penguin movement strategy; 
  given that the exploration depth is a parameter `N`, there should be at least two unit tests for different depths 
  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/wickett/tree/c82cb324192449b4a09a686c5841bef2d88f10d0/Fish/Player/UnitTests/StrategyTest.py#L70-L186
  
  
- any game-tree functionality you had to add to create the `xtree` test harness:
  - where the functionality is defined in `game-tree.PP`
  - where the functionality is used in `xtree`
  - you may wish to submit a `git-diff` for `game-tree` and any auxiliary modules
