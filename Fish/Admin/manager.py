# The manager object runs an entire tournament of the Fish game
# given a list of players, the list of players don't have to be in any
# particular order

# At the start of a tournament, the manager informs all the players that the
# Tournament will be started.

# The tournament uses a knock-out elimination system. The top finisher(s) of every game of round n move on to round n+1. The tournament ends when two tournament rounds of games in a row produce the exact same winners, when there are too few players for a single game, or when the number of participants has become small enough to run a single final game. In both cases, the surviving players will be the tournament winners.

# The allocation of players to games works as follows. The manager starts by assigning them to games with the maximal number of participants permitted in ascending order of age. Once the number of remaining players drops below the maximal number and canâ€™t form a game, the manager backtracks by one game and tries games of size one less than the maximal number and so on until all players are assigned.

# When the tournament is over, the manager informs all remaining active players whether they won or lost. Winners that fail to accept this message become losers.
